/**
 * Shared request payload for the Model Proxy Filter probes (spawn-mode
 * testSingleConfigWithModel and api-mode probeModelViaChatCore).
 *
 * `max_tokens` is deliberately omitted. Upstreams enforce different minimum
 * caps — e.g. opencode's muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free rejects anything
 * below 16 with HTTP 400, which made every xray config "fail" regardless of
 * proxy quality — and OpenAI reasoning models reject `max_tokens` outright in
 * favor of `max_completion_tokens`. With the field absent, each upstream
 * applies its own default, and target-format translators that require it
 * inject one during translation (openai→claude and openai→commandcode:
 * adjustMaxTokens/DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS; openai→gemini simply omits the optional
 * maxOutputTokens). The probe's pass/fail signal is
 * HTTP 2xx, so the uncapped reply length only affects latency, which is
 * bounded by the job's timeoutMs.

 * hold it indefinitely. The abandoned upstream request dies with the
 * caller's teardown: spawn mode kills its temp xray in `finally`; api-mode
 * swaps or removes the worker's outbound on the next probe / at job stop.
 * A late rejection of the losing promise is swallowed so it can never
 * surface as an unhandled rejection after the race settles.
